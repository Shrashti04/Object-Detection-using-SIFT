# Object-Detection-using-SIFT
Implemented SIFT from scratch and use it between images for object finding/identification. Apart from object identification, weâ€™ve applied the algorithm for similarity detection as well on live images taken from camera.
This repository contains Python code for detecting and matching Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) keypoints in images using scratch and comparing with OpenCV library as well as did template matching. For application, did real time detection.

## Requirements for setup
Make sure this these things should be include in your system:<br>
    1. Python 3.x\
    2. OpenCV\
    3. NumPy\
    4. Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies:\
`pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib`
2. Clone the repository:\
`git clone https://github.com/Shrashti04/Object-Detection-using-SIFT.git`
3. Navigate to the repository directory:\
`cd Object-Detection-using-SIFT`
4. Place your query image and scene image in the repository directory.
5. Run the main script:\
`python SIFT.py`
6. View the output: <br>
If enough matches are found, the script will display the scene image with the detected object highlighted.
If not enough matches are found, a message will be printed indicating the insufficient matches.
